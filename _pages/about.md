I am a final-year PhD student in the School of ECE at Purdue University, advised by Dr. Stanley Chan.

My research has primarily focused on developing a mechanistic understanding of deep neural networks, towards the goal of improving the generalization and interpretability of these models, and bridging the gap between theory and practice. 

In particular, my recent efforts revolve around studying how LLMs reason. In [a recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04105), we studied how tiny transformers and LLMs (Mistral-7B and Gemma-2-9B) solve simple propositional logic problems. At a high level, we were able to show the existence of, and characterizes the circuit employed by LLMs in the wild for solving a nontrivial logic problem which demands latent multi-hop reasoning. In the past, I developed mathematical theories which connect generalization performance of DNNs with their feature-learning process, in the settings of [transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23129), and [feature-based distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07600).

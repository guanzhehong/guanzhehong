I am a final-year PhD student in the School of ECE at Purdue University, advised by Dr. Stanley Chan. I obtained my BASc in Computer Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Toronto.

My research interests primarily revolve around developing a **mechanistic** understanding of deep neural networks, towards the goals of improving the **generalization** and **interpretability** of these models, and bridging the gap between theory and practice. 

In particular, my recent efforts have been focused on studying **how large language models (LLMs) reason**. In [a recent work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04105v3), we studied how tiny transformers and LLMs (Mistral-7B and Gemma-2-9B) solve simple propositional logic problems. We were able to characterize _circuits_ employed by LLMs for performing latent multi-hop reasoning. The surprisingly localized and human-interpretable nature of the circuits point to the possibilities of _debugging_ and _steering_ the LLMs' reasoning actions in the future.

I have also developed _mathematical_ theories which connect _generalization_ performance of DNNs with their **feature-learning** process, in the settings of [transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23129), and [feature-based distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07600).

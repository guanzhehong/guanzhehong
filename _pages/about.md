I am a final-year PhD student in the School of ECE at Purdue University, advised by Dr. Stanley Chan. I obtained my BASc in Computer Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Toronto.

My research interests primarily revolve around developing a **mechanistic** understanding of deep neural networks, towards the goals of improving the **generalization** and **interpretability** of these models, and bridging the gap between theory and practice. 

In particular, my recent efforts have been focused on studying **how large language models (LLMs) reason**. In [a recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04105), we studied how tiny transformers and LLMs (Mistral-7B and Gemma-2-9B) solve simple propositional logic problems. At a high level, we were able to show the existence of, and characterize the _circuits_ employed by LLMs in the wild for solving a nontrivial logic problem which demands latent multi-hop reasoning. We found these circuits to be surprisingly human-interpretable, which points to the possibility of **debugging** and **steering** the LLMs' reasoning actions in the future.

I have also developed _mathematical_ theories which connect generalization performance of DNNs with their _feature-learning_ process, in the settings of [transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23129), and [feature-based distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07600).
